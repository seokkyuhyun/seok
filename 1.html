    Singapore Changi Airport, commonly known as Changi Airport (IATA: SIN, ICAO: WSSS), is a major civilian international airport that serves Singapore, and is one of the largest transportation hubs in Asia. As one of the world's busiest airports by international passenger and cargo traffic, it is currently rated the World's Best Airport by Skytrax, the first airport in the world to do so for eight consecutive years.[8][9] It has also been rated as one of the world's cleanest airports and highly rated international transit airports.[10][11] More than 100 airlines operate from the airport, with nonstop or direct flights to destinations in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and North America.[12]
<p>
The airport is located within its namesake district of Changi, at the eastern end of Singapore, approximately 24 km (15 mi) east from Singapore's Downtown Core at the Central Region on a 15-square-kilometre (5.8 sq mi) site.[13] It is the home base of BOC Aviation and Jetstar Asia Airways, as well as the country's flag carrier of Singapore Airlines, its cargo division Singapore Airlines Cargo and its low-cost subsidiary Scoot.[14]
</p>
<p>
With Singapore's strategic location being a favourable destination for high demand layovers, the airport also serves as a focus city for AirAsia, All Nippon Airways and Qantas, as well as the flagship cargo hub for Fedex Express in Asia.[2][3]
</p>
<p>
In 2019, Changi served 68.3 million passengers, making it the 18th busiest airport in the world.[15] The airport is operated by Changi Airport Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Singapore.
